1. What is an Operating System?

An operating system (OS) is the primary software that manages all the hardware and other software on a computer. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer's hardware, coordinating the execution of programs and enabling communication between hardware components.

2. Key Functions of an Operating System:

a) Resource Management: Manages the computer's CPU, memory, disk space, and peripheral devices.

b) File Management: Organizes, stores, retrieves, and manages files on the storage drives.

c) User Interface: Provides a way for users to interact with the computer, either through a graphical user interface (GUI) or a command-line interface (CLI).

d) Task Scheduling and Multitasking: Allocates processing time to different applications and handles multiple tasks simultaneously.

e) Security and Access Control: Protects data by controlling access to files, programs, and resources.

3. Types of Operating Systems

a) Batch OS: Executes jobs in batches without user interaction.

b) Time-sharing OS: Allows multiple users to share system resources simultaneously.

c) Distributed OS: Manages a collection of independent computers and makes them appear as a single system.

d) Clustered OS: Uses multiple computers to work together and improve performance and reliability.

e) Embedded OS: Designed for specialized devices like IoT, ATMs, and industrial control systems.

f) Real-time OS: Processes data within a strict time limit for applications like aerospace and medical devices.

3. Process States

In an operating system, a process (a program in execution) transitions through various states based on its progress and the availability of resources. The main process states are as follows:

a) New: The process is being created. In this initial state, resources are allocated, and the process is set up in memory.

b) Ready: The process is loaded into memory and ready to run but is waiting for CPU time to execute. Multiple processes may be in the ready state, queued up by the operating system.

c) Running: The process is currently being executed by the CPU. Only one process per CPU core can be in the running state at a time.

d) Blocked (or Waiting): The process cannot proceed until some external event occurs (e.g., waiting for input/output operations to complete). It moves to the blocked state until it’s ready to run again.

e) Terminated (or Exit): The process has completed its execution or has been terminated by the OS. All resources are released, and the process is removed from the system.

f) Suspended/Blocked: A process in the waiting state might be suspended to free up memory, moving it to a secondary storage area.

g) Suspended/Ready: A process that was in the suspended/blocked state returns to the ready queue but remains in secondary storage until it’s moved back to primary memory.

Process State Transitions
Ready → Running: The OS scheduler assigns CPU time to the process.
Running → Waiting: The process requires a resource and pauses execution.
Running → Ready: The process’s CPU time slice expires, and it returns to the ready state.
Waiting → Ready: The required resource becomes available, allowing the process to continue.
These transitions help the OS manage multitasking efficiently, ensuring that processes run smoothly and utilize system resources effectively.

4. Process Scheduling

Preemptive Scheduling: Allows the OS to interrupt a running process and allocate CPU to another.

Non-Preemptive Scheduling: The process runs until completion or voluntarily gives up CPU.
