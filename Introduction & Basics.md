1. What is an Operating System?

An OS is system software that manages hardware and software resources.

It provides an interface for users to interact with the computer.

2. Types of Operating Systems

Batch OS: Executes jobs in batches without user interaction.

Time-sharing OS: Allows multiple users to share system resources simultaneously.

Distributed OS: Manages a collection of independent computers and makes them appear as a single system.

Clustered OS: Uses multiple computers to work together and improve performance and reliability.

Embedded OS: Designed for specialized devices like IoT, ATMs, and industrial control systems.

Real-time OS: Processes data within a strict time limit for applications like aerospace and medical devices.

3. Process States

New: Process is created but not yet ready for execution.

Ready: Process is waiting for CPU allocation.

Running: Process is executing on the CPU.

Waiting: Process is waiting for an event (I/O completion, resource availability).

Terminated: Process has finished execution.

4. Process Scheduling

Preemptive Scheduling: Allows the OS to interrupt a running process and allocate CPU to another.

Non-Preemptive Scheduling: The process runs until completion or voluntarily gives up CPU.
